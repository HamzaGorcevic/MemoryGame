# Simple Card Memory Game


Welcome to the Simple Card Memory Game! This is a basic memory game implemented in JavaScript where players need to match pairs of cards with the same symbol. The game offers three difficulty modes: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The objective is to find all matching pairs in the shortest number of moves.

# How to Play

1. **Select a Difficulty**: When you launch the game, you'll be prompted to choose a difficulty mode. Each mode varies in the number of cards and their arrangement on the board.

2. **Gameplay**: Click on a card to reveal its symbol. Try to remember the symbols on the cards as you click them. Click on a second card to see if you've found a matching pair. If the symbols match, the cards will stay face-up. If they don't match, they will be flipped back face-down.

3. **Winning**: The game is won when all pairs have been successfully matched and all cards are face-up.

4. **Restart**: Restart when level is completed.
